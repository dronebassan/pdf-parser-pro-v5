## 🚨 Critical Launch Blockers

### 🔑 **1. API Keys Required (High Priority)**
```bash
# Required for AI features to work
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"  
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

**Impact**: Without these, system works in library-only mode (still functional but missing key differentiator)

### 💳 **2. Payment System Setup (High Priority)**
```bash
# Required for monetization
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_live_..."
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_live_..."
```

**Impact**: Cannot accept payments or manage subscriptions
