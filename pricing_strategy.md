## 💡 **PSYCHOLOGICAL PRICING TRICKS**

### **1. The "Anchoring Effect"**
Always show competitor prices first:
```
"Others charge $25,000/year... You pay $299/month"
"Adobe wants $25K minimum... Start with us for FREE"
```

### **2. The "Goldilocks Effect"**
Make GROWTH plan irresistible:
- FREE: Too limited for serious use
- GROWTH: Perfect value ($19 = price of lunch)
- BUSINESS: Expensive for small companies

### **3. The "Loss Aversion"**
Show what they LOSE with competitors:
```
"Adobe: $25,000 upfront commitment"
"Us: Cancel anytime, no commitments"
```
